Create coupons URLs from any URL on your site. Apply a coupon by visiting a custom link from your domain, like example.com/code/9785895

== Description ==

A 100% free plugin. Free forever. No "pro" version. Premium quality. Made for WooCommerce.

Compatible with WooCommerce 9.4.* (latest)

Coupon URLs is a WooCommerce extension that allows you to apply a WooCommerce coupon by clicking a custom link on your site. You have full control over the URL. You can create any URL you want from your own domain, there are no limits or restrictions:

* Examples:
    * https://example.com/?code=FALL50
    * https://example.com/code/FALL50
    * https://example.com/FALL50
    * https://example.com/offers/?code=FALL50
    * https://example.com/a/very/deep/path

You can also add a WooCommerce product automatically before adding the coupon.

##Add a product before adding the coupon
Coupon URLs allows you to add a product from your store automatically before applying the discount/coupon. You can even select the quantity!

For example, you can create a custom link like: https://example.com/code/FREEORANGE that when clicked will add 1 Orange and then the coupon FREEORANGE will be applied adding a 100% discount (just as an example).

##Redirect to the cart, the checkout page or any other page after applying the coupon
You can select *any* page on your site to redirect to after applying the coupon. Want to redirect to the cart? The checkout page? A specific product page? A custom page? We got you covered!

Redirect to:
* Cart (WooCommerce)
* Checkout (WooCommerce)
* Shop (WooCommerce)
* Homepage
* Any page on your site
* A custom path on your site (eg: example.com/a/custom-path)
* An external URL 

##Smart apply
If the customer's cart is empty (and you haven't added the Add Product action), Coupon URLs will remember to add the coupon as soon as the customer adds a product to their cart. No manual action needed.

##Beautiful builder
Coupon URLs has been designed as a builder so that you can add only the actions that you want to perform after the link has been clicked, visually.

* 5 actions: 
    * Add coupon.
    * Add Product.
    * Add an Extra Message After Applying to the Cart.
    * Add Custom Message When Coupon hasn't been added yet.
    * Redirect
